# SHITPOSTIFY

Needed a way to quickly mock someone's comment online, with minimal effort? Thankfully, **shitpostify** fills that gap for you!

All you need to do is install the extension, right click on a highlighted block of text, then click `Shitpostify highlighted text?` to see that Internet Tough Guy's comment ridiculed.

## Installation:

Until this is published on the Chrome store, it will have to be installed from source.

- Download the source code by going to the `"Clone or Download"` button, and click `"Download ZIP"`.
- Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and make sure developer mode is enabled (top right)
- Select `"Load unpacked"` and upload the `.zip` you just downloaded.

You're done!

## Demo media: 
(looks like Loom does not show the right click menu or the popup box with the text, but you get the gist. I'll use a better screen recording later)
