# SHITPOSTIFY

## Needed a way to quickly mock someone's comment on the internet, with minimal effort? Thankfully, shitpostify fills that gap for you!

## All you need to do is install the extension, right click on a highlighted block of text, then click `Shitpostify text` to see that Internet Tough Guy's comment ridiculed.

## Demo: (looks like Loom does not show the right click menu or the popup box with the text, but you get the gist. I'll use a better screen recording later)
